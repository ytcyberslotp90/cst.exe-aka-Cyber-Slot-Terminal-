📌 ABOUT CYBER SLOT TERMINAL
-----------------------------
Cyber Slot Terminal (aka cst.exe / C.S Terminal) is a creative and interactive command-line interface  
made entirely using Windows Batch scripting (converted to .exe).

Unlike traditional CMD, this terminal comes with:

✅ ASCII & Unicode character support  
✅ CMD.exe + CST.exe hybrid commands  
✅ Animated visual effects (glitch, scanlines, wave, etc.)  
✅ Text-based app launcher  
✅ Python support  
   - If Python is installed, CST will use it  
   - If not, CST will offer to auto-install Python for you  
✅ Easter Egg.
This is your own hacking-style terminal — stylish, fun, and powerful!
